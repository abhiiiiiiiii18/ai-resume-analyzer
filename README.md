‚ú® Introduction
This is an AI-powered Resume Analyzer built with React, React Router, and Puter.js. It's designed to streamline the job application process by helping candidates optimize their resumes for specific job listings. The application handles authentication, allows users to upload and store resumes, and then uses a powerful AI to provide custom feedback and an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score tailored to a given job description.

This project offers a solid foundation for a hackathon, with a clean, reusable UI and modern features. Fork this repo and get a head start on building your own innovative application.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
React: A foundational JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces with reusable components.

React Router v7: The go-to routing library for handling navigation within the app, featuring nested routes and error boundaries.

Puter.com & Puter.js: An open-source internet operating system and its corresponding client-side SDK. Puter.js provides a serverless backend for auth, storage, database, and AI integrations (GPT, Claude, etc.)‚Äîall without needing to set up a separate server.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom, responsive designs.

TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, improving code quality and maintainability for large-scale applications.

Vite: A fast build tool and dev server that offers instant startup and hot-module replacement for a superior developer experience.

Zustand: A minimal, hook-based state management library for managing global state with zero boilerplate.

üîã Features
This project comes with a set of powerful, pre-built features to help you hit the ground running at your hackathon:

Serverless Auth: Handle user authentication entirely in the browser with Puter.js‚Äîno backend setup required.

Resume Storage: A secure and reliable way to let users upload and store their resumes.

AI Resume Matching: An intelligent system that takes a job description and provides an ATS score and customized feedback.

Reusable UI Components: The codebase is built with clean, consistent components that you can easily reuse and adapt for new features.

Cross-Device Compatibility: A fully responsive design that works seamlessly on any device.
