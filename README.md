## ✨ Introduction  
RESUMIND is an AI-powered Resume Analyzer built with React, React Router, and Puter.js.  
It streamlines the job application process by helping candidates optimize their resumes for specific job listings.  

The app handles authentication, allows users to upload and store resumes, and then uses AI to provide custom feedback and an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score tailored to a given job description.  

This project offers a solid foundation for a hackathon, with a clean, reusable UI and modern features. Fork this repo and get a head start on building your own innovative application.
